# Lightning Lunch Backend

## Introduction

Welcome to the Lightning Lunch backend project. We're going to be building a Spring service to power our UI application.

### Why Java
Sainsbury's Tech uses a bunch of different programming languages so why is this introduction using Java? A large number of our projects are written in Java, so you'll likely be exposed to it at some point in your three rotations - and even if you end up working in a team that uses another language, the concepts and principles you'll learn in this project remain the same.

### Why Spring
If you're building an API in Java, Spring normally isn't far away. It's a framework that gives you a lot of building blocks, so that you can focus on your business logic and get something up and running quickly. A large number of our APIs running in production are built on Spring. [Read More](https://spring.io/why-spring)

### How to use this project
This repository represents the application you'll build across many different steps. The `main` branch is the application in its starting state. There will then be branches for each step of the tutorial, showing what the project should look like at the end of that step.  
For example, `step-2-code` will be the application at the *end* of following all of the instructions in step 2. We recommend trying to follow this guide, and build your own application from scratch, but the branches are there if you get lost and need a clean starting point.  
  
Our recommended approach is to start a new project of your own from scratch, and not build on this repo. You can always borrow code from here if you get stuck!
